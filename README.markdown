# GameOfLife.java

## Introduction

This is a java implementation of the classical [Cellular Automata][ca] problem that was presented to me during one of my IS200 lab exercises.

There is no special algorithm used in solving this zero-player game.

## Usage

	$ java GameOfLife [Max Iterations]

If the `[Max Iterations]` argument is not set, it will exit upon reaching 300 iterations.

### Configuration

Refer to GameOfLife.input.txt for detailed description and instructions for defining the initial state or generation 0.

## Feedback

Any suggestions for improving efficiency and or coding improvements are welcome, via pull requests.
